<p>Research Interests
The STI Research Lab conducts research in software engineering to design, develop, and evaluate tools and techniques that help software developers build better software by automating different tasks during the life cycle of a software system by analyzing its code and its development process. In particular, the STI Research Lab uses various Artificial Intelligence (machine learning, metaheuristics, deep learning) and Data Science (data mining, data analysis, knowledge extraction, statistics) techniques to address various problems in software engineering. We have a specific interest and expertise in the following topics:</p>

<p>Automating Software Development Using Artificial Intelligence
Search Based Software Engineering
Software Maintenance and Evolution
Software Refactoring
Technical Debt and Software Quality Assurance
Empirical Software Engineering
Human aspects in Software Engineering
Our approaches have proven quite influential in academia and industry. The publications page lists the published research works achieved by the STI Research Lab members.</p>
